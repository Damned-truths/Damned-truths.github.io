<h4>This Site:</h4>
    This site was created as a learning experience and to help my understanding of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheet">CSS</a>. I started to learn HTML and CSS using <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a>, a site dedicated to the teaching of coding and website construction for free. I have also drawn on information that can be found via various web searches. Websites such as MDN (Mozilla Developers Network), a website made by the Mozilla foundation to explain different aspects of coding etc, especially HTML and CSS, and Stack Overflow, a forum-style website about programing and coding, were useful in the development of this website. It uses jekyll to create templates for each page and is hosted with <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.
	I am also active on a site called <a title="Photography - Stack Exchange" href="http://photo.stackexchange.com">Photography - Stack Exchange</a>
